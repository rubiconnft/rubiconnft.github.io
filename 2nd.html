    <p>Would rate this company a 4 out of 10. I met with David on a call and although he was a cool guy he was very pushy on selling services we simply did not need. This company is based out of Australia. After I told him we only need the artwork and no need for any marketing service he went ghost on me. I think he was most likely outsourcing the Artwork. </p>

                <p>Overall I give damien a 9 out of 10. He has some really solid work and comes in with a very reasonable offer. After explaining to Damien what we would like he said it would take him about 2 weeks to create the art. He also allows for unlimited revisions which is really helpful.</p>

            <p>Overall the communication was intally very confusing as he told me his name was Mike but when I got all the information in an email, it was from a gentleman named Nick. Overall I think the estimate was so low as they are based out of Malasyia. It seems as they would provide decent work but I think we can do better.</p>

                    <ul><li>Thoughts:</li>
            <p>I think going with Dicaso is our best option. He has a great amount of experience compared to the rest of the field and also has a great understanding of Rubicon. Dicaso also replies almost instantly which is very nice. I also think he as the best understanding of our project. The one downside is that he is the most expensive. Note; Dicaso is the artist for Optichads and Optipunks.</p>

                    <p>Found them online and noticed they had an office in Plano, TX so I figured I would email them and request that we meet in person. The biggest red flag from the beginning was when I asked them for there past work they told me they cant show me anything. Very sketchy. I figured I would go to the meeting in Plano anyways but while I was on my way there they emailed me to not to come to the office unless I was signing a contract. Overall I would highly suggest avoiding this place at all costs. Estimate was $18,000.
